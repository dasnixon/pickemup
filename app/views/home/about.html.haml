        %p
          At Pickemup we want to get it right the first time. That's why we built our technical recruiting service around our application
          that eliminates having to dig around resumes, sift through LinkedIn, fill out meaningless profiles or rely on other expensive
          people and tools that know little about the software engineering world. Pickemup was built and is run by developers who want
          to change the way the recruiting process works. We want to do everything we can to make sure that you get exactly what you're
          looking for.

          For an employer you no longer need to look hard. Sign up, clean up your profile, add job listings, and begin
          finding the developers that we know will fit your company culture, work hard, and help take you to the next level. We have
          a wicked fast and smart algorithm that makes any recruiter look silly. Beyond that, we have a wide range of services from pre-screenings to
          full technical interviews that we provide. We strive for the ultimate customer service and will do what we can to make the recruiting
          process as pain free as possible, while also delivering to you the perfect developer.

          For a developer, we know the pain. Wasting days talking with recruiters who do not know a thing about what it means to be a
          software engineer is frustrating. Sign in with your GitHub or LinkedIn, setup your preferences, and it is off to the races. You will
          immediately be able to find, search, and narrow down the perfect company that you've always been looking for. Also, we strive
          to make sure you speak directly to those that matter. No longer do you have to take 10 meaningless phone calls, everything there is
          to know about your background is cleanly organized and within a click of a button.

            Stop having to spend hours setting up profiles, filling out resumes, and doing unnecessary amounts of work
            to begin using Pickemup. We use Crunchbase to get company information and reduce the time it takes to setup a profile.
            Furthermore, developers can sync their GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stackoverflow profiles. All developers have to do is
            setup their preferences and they should see job listings in no time.

          %p
            We always hear that technical recruiting is one of the hardest tasks for a company to do. That's why we took our own
            personal experiences, our friends experiences, and outside opinions about the recruitment process to come up
            with what we think is a perfect way to change the way recruitment is done. We know that using our product you will
            be satisfied with the results, and everyone will win.
