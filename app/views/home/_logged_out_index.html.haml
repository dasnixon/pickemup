              to reduce the time it takes for a company to get started using Pickemup.

          Changing the Game
        %p
          At Pickemup we want to change the way recruiting is done. No more spamming inboxes, no more incompetent recruiters
          who have never written a line of code, no more insane recruiting fees, no more sifting resumes and
          job listings; just a company run by developers that wants to provide a service that will give you the opportunity
          to discover the company or developer that you want, no transparency. We also want to provide the highest level
          of customer service, and make sure that everyone is 100% satisfied, no matter what. We are here to go out of our
          way to make one of the hardest processes as easy as it can get.
